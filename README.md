## 1. Batter Performance Analysis Against CSK at Chepauk Stadium in Middle Overs

This repository explores the performance of various batters against the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in T20 matches at Chepauk Stadium, Chennai. Given Chepauk’s spin-friendly pitch, the analysis focuses on how batters fare during the middle overs (7–15), where CSK frequently utilizes a spin-heavy bowling lineup. This project includes data analysis, visual representations, and performance metrics to assess player efficiency against spin at this venue.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Identify the top-performing batters against CSK at Chepauk Stadium, particularly in the middle overs.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **Player Performance**: Assess individual contributions, strike rate, and boundary frequency.
  - **Spin Adaptability**: Examine each batter's effectiveness in handling spin-heavy conditions.
  - **Time Frame**: Emphasis on recent player performance within the last five years to highlight current trends and insights.

## Contents
1. **Performance Metrics and Assumptions**  
   - Includes detailed images of performance criteria weights, assumptions, and pairwise comparison matrices to provide a clear framework for how performance scores were derived.
2. **Middle Overs Analysis**  
   - Emphasis on overs 7-15, where spinners are most commonly deployed.
3. **Recent Player Performance**  
   - Focused insights on recent trends over the last five years to highlight players who have shown strong adaptability to Chepauk's conditions.

## Key Findings
- **Top Batters in Overall Performance**:
  - *Shane Watson*: Highest score based on strike rate and boundary frequency.
  - *AB de Villiers*: Strong adaptability and efficient scoring in challenging middle-over conditions with an least dot percentage.
  
- **Recent (Last 5 years) Top Batters**:
  - *Nicolas Pooran*: Sudden game changing capability under pressure with a great strike rate(200+).
  - *Marcus Stoinis*: Strategic middle-over play, leveraging familiarity with Chepauk's pitch with least dot percentage and outstanding strike rate.
  
## Methodology
- **Data Analysis Framework**:
  - **Runs Per innings (RPI)**: Measures average runs scored per innings.
  - **Balls Per Boundary (BPB)**: Indicates boundary frequency and scoring efficiency.
  - **Strike Rate (SR)**: Key for evaluating batting speed, particularly in T20 format.
  - **Dot Percentage (Dot %)**: Capability of strike rotating that contribute to team win.
  - **Balls Per Dismissal (BPB)**: Capability of holding wickets in difficult situations.
- **Comparison Method**: 
  - **Pairwise Comparison Matrix**: Used to rank batters by various metrics.
  - **Criteria Weights**: Emphasis on critical metrics like strike rate and boundary rate for a fair performance score calculation.

## Visualizations
- **Criteria Weights and Pairwise Matrices**: 
  - Visual representations included to clarify assumptions and criteria weights.
  - These images provide transparency in metric selection and weighting in the ranking process.

## Conclusion
It thus concluded that the batters who performed well against spin and could change their scoring pattern while performing good are good enough in the middle overs at Chepauk against CSK. Retired players such as **Shane Watson** and **AB de Villiers**(Both performed better in *1st Innings*) were highly consistent in those situations due to their aggressive yet adaptive natures. Among the available players, **Nicolas Pooran** and **Marcus Stoinis**(Both of them played even better in *2nd Innings*). They control aggression and play strategically during the match against CSK at Chepauk.
